Spring bean life cycle
------------------------

1)
By implementing DisposableBean and InitializingBean one can override destroy Method and afterPropertiesSet method 
for pre destory and post initialization.

Interface (InitializingBean)               Method(destory)                        function(pre destroy)
Interface (DisposableBean)                 Method(afterPropertiesSet)             function(post initialization)

2) second method we can configure through bean by providing init-method and destory-method in the bean configuration xml file.

3) Thirdly, spring framework support @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy Annotation to accomplish these goals.
